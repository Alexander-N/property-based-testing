Property based testing with Hypothesis
======================
Notebook for [Python User Group Freiburg](http://www.meetup.com/Python-User-Group-Freiburg/events/228761684/)

Instead of hand-picking examples as in classical testing, property based testing uses randomly generated data to assert general properties of the results. With hypothesis there is an excellent python library which can be used with any common testing framework. I believe every software developer should know about this concept and in this session I'll try to show by example why it's a great idea.
